# SequenceReadMutator

SequenceReadMutator simulates the following five different mutation types within an input sequence read set and the percentage of reads mutated: mutations at the start of sequence reads (20%), mutations at the end of sequence reads (20%), clustered mutations within sequence reads (20%) and point mutations within sequence reads (30%).

## Usage

It takes a file containing sequence reads to be mutated as input and outputs a file containing the mutated sequence reads. 

The script should be run with the following commands:
```python
python sequencereadmutator.py seq_file out_file
```
